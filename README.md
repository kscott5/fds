## [Project Road Map (Pitch)](https://catalog.workshops.aws/serverless-patterns/en-US/business-scenario)
As more people work remotely, restaurants have experienced huge growth for carry-out orders. Customers want dishes from their favorite restaurants, but they are also more aware and concerned about the environmental impact of delivery services.

A startup company received funding to connect restaurants and nearby customers. The new service will exclusively use electric bike riders to pick up and deliver food to hyperlocal customers. The goal is to create a fast, economical, and environmentally friendly delivery service.
